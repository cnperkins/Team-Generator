Title: Team-Generator

Description: This is a Team generator. After running 'node app.js' in the terminal the user will be prompted with questions. The users answers will be written into a new HTML Which I have named Team.html There you will see the output into an html page that will build your team of managers, interns and engineers.

Here is a link to a screen recording of the generator in action.
